February 13 2023:
Today we actually got Project Animob setup by installing all the requirements and getting the docker containers set up. We decided to use MongoDB as our database. We made some changes to our wireframes to condense our project.

February 14 2023:
Today wasn't the best time. We started working on authentication and we've been stuck all day. We would get something working but then something else went wrong. Hopefully we will get something working tommorrow.

February 15 2023:
Today we got authentication to work on the backend. We were ecstatic. Next we started to work on our API endpoints. We got some of them to work but but ran into an issue with our genre list because our third party api doesn't have one. I found a workaround for that by hardcoding a list of genres. We all took turn driving so today went by pretty smooth.

February 16 2023:
Sarah was the driver for most of the day. We started working on the query and routers. We got a few of them to work but ran into an issue with a few of them as well. After some searching and help from SEIRS we got them to work.

February 21 2023:
It's safe to say that authentication in general is pretty hard. We tried to implement Redux into our project for front-end authentication but it didn't go well at all. We're gonna pick this up tomorrow and see what happens. We're thinking about just going the React way instead.

February 22 2023:
We got rid of the Redux way and went with the React way for front-end authentication. Everything went much smoother and we knocked it out in a few hours. We work really well together.

February 23 2023:
Today we got most of our routes done for React. Sarah & Jaiden came through with the CSS for our pages while Tad and I drove to create simple versions of our pages. We're looking good out here.

February 27 2023:
Today was a sad day for the ANIMOB. The owner of our third party API took the API down because of lack of funds. We have been searching for a replacement for a few hours now.
UPDATE: Tyler is the GOAT SEIR. He helped us find a work around by hosting the API ourselves. One thing about Tyler is that he never gives up on you. Shoutout to him.

February 28 2023:
Today we worked on creating our add to favorites and delete favorites button. This is pretty difficult. We went to Justin for some help because he had a similar function with his project. We haven't gotten it to work all the way yet. Hopefully we'll get it to work tomorrow.

March 1 2023:
We got the favorites to work but we're getting some error messages in the console. Today Sarah got our carousel to work. Everything is coming together now.

March 2 2023:
Today Sarah added a second carousel for our profile page. I was able to fix the second carousel so that it shows under our first carousel. I also updated the profile cards. The website is looking pretty legit now.

March 3 2023:
Today Sarah worked on the login and signup pages and added a very cool animation. I made some adjustments to the profile cards. The login page is so cool. I just had to say that again.

March 4 2023:
Worked on the cards on the website some more and changed all the fonts for the website to make it more stylish. Sarah fixed the carousel on the main page for our editors picks and added a translucent background for all of our cards.

March 6 2023:
Today Jaiden added some favorites buttons to our profile page. I switched some of our background images to give the site some more flavor. Sarah made some changes to our detail page because we hated the design of the original. We also fixed the plus minus error that we were getting in the console.

March 7 2023:
Today we worked on our unit tests. Tad drove while we all worked on figuring out how to do this exactly. It took us some time but we finally got it to work and every test passed. Jaiden fixed the issue we were getting in the console when adding anime to our favorites list. I found a way to add an add to favorites button to our editors pick list.

March 8 2023:
We have reached the finish line. ANIMOB is finally finished. The best Team in our Cohort. You heard it here first.
