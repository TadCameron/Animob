    Slow going today, but we got the containers working. I was at the helm while everyone else supported.
    We were trying to get mongo working and spin up the containers. Took a while and some SEIR magic, but
    they're up now. The problem ended up being the CRLF end of line sequencer. Whatever that is. All I know is I had to set it to LF, I think because I'm windows. Jaiden (also windows) had to do something the same thing. We went our separate ways so we can get the reading done.


2.14

    Rough one. We really lack the basic comprehension to do much right now. Spent most of the day struggling
    to make some endpoints, never got very far. We used ChatGPT a lot, asking it to explain some of this code to us. Made a little bit of progress doing that. All in all, some steps forward on general knowledge but
    the project is a little stalled.


2.15

    Authentication stuff. We're still working as one group, switching drivers. Got the genres hardcoded since the API doesnt have them included. We should be able to implement them pretty quick. Little progress today but mostly struggle bussin'.


2.16

    Sarah drove a lot today and we kept plugging on the back end. Finally got somewhere thanks to our new friend ChatGPT. It's an amazing era we're living in. Thank God I didn't learn to code in the 90's.


2.21

    Rough. Day. We tried to learn Redux and it just didn't go well. Even with Sean, we just couldn't wrap our brains around it. We threw in the towel at the end of the day, but maybe someone will have a breakthrough tonight. Honestly, I don't think we need it. The states of our app aren't that complicated and I'm sure we can figure out how to do it with just the regular hooks. Will check back in tomorrow.


2.22

    We did indeed just use React. I did a lot of driving today and we made a lot of progress. More ChatGPT, more progress. It really feels like cheating but I don't think it is. (If instructors are reading this and it is in fact cheating, this is an elaborate joke. Just so you know.) I  THINK we have the authentication done, but I'm not sure. I honestly am pretty lost when it comes to the auth stuff.


2.23

    More front end routes. It actually feels like we're getting close to the end here, but I don't even want to say that out loud. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.


2.28

    So, hilariously, the API we're using has been taken down due to "a lack of funds." We really drew the short straw here. Tyler was A HUGE help, we ended up just hosting it ourselves. Actually hosting it through Tyler's account. We'll have to go back and make sure we host it ourselves, maybe that will improve the speed a bit because it's REAL slow. We have the workaround going now so we had a little more progress but it was still not a banner day.


3.2

    So the MVP is basically done. Sarah and Row have a lot they want to change in the front end, but it looks like if we turned it in now, we'd actually pass. What a miracle. Calling it early today. I'll come back tomorrow and try and gget some of these pages looking nicer.
