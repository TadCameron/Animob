2.13

    Slow going today, but we got the containers working. I was at the helm while everyone else supported.
    We were trying to get mongo working and spin up the containers. Took a while and some SEIR magic, but
    they're up now. The problem ended up being the CRLF end of line sequencer. Whatever that is. All I know is I
    had to set it to LF, I think because I'm windows. Jaiden (also windows) had to do something the same thing. We
    went our separate ways so we can get the reading done.
