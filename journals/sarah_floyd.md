Feb 21-

Feb 16- Today I did a lot of the driving and made the favorites query and routers. Some of them worked, but then others we had to put all of our brains together to fix it. The big ah-ha moment was that we were getting a type error for one of the models and str() around row['id'] was missing.

Feb 15- I worked on authenticaiton after class Febuary 14, and got it almost to work. Then we all worked on it together, periodically changing out who was driving. After that we did some of our endpoints for our API to work. A big ah-ha moment for the group was when Row made a hardcoded list of genres to populate. Our api doesnt have a list of genres that can be clicked on to see what shows are available; it only has genre/{genre}. We still have to figure out how to connect those

Feb 14 - today we all worked on trying to get up the authenication information. It didn't work very well, and it felt like we would take 2 steps forward and 10 steps back.

Feb 13 - today we all worked on setting up MongoDB together. We also discussed changing our wireframes/condensing information and how we would access certain endpoints or filter data to have better recommended shows for users. One ah-ha moment I had was when creating our db.py file. The os.environ was not being accessed until I realized that we needed to import os.
